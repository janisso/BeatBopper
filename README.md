Conducting interface for controlling Tempo and Loudness using Leap Motion

Currently only Naive tempo estimation works. To run copy this directory and run

python main.py -u user_number -m waltz

-u creates a folder with user numberto save data in csv format
-m is the midi file to be played, the score follower currently allows to play only one file. Will be updated soon

check the __init__.py in libs folder to check what libraries are needed
